  <h1 id="head-center">Women in Freemasonry</h1>

  <blockquote>"The entry of women into Masonry, hand in hand with men, is full of the fairest augury for the future, for it will reknit the ancient tie between Masonry and the inner worlds, will reopen the ancient channels in which the water of life can flow, and shed once more the pure white light on all who pray for its bestowal. Masonry, thus restored and revived, will play a great part in preparing the world for the future, in proclaiming and popularizing the ideals necessary for its molding, in shaping the new order in which wisdom as authority shall wed with liberty, and ensure cooperation and progress. To this high end is Co-Masonry ordained."</blockquote>

  <p>So stated the Very Ills. Bro. Annie Besant 33Â°, former Grand Commander of the Eastern Federation of the Co-Freemasonic Order, in reference to the full readmission of women to the Masonic Craft. The participation of women in Freemasonic work is not an innovation; it is simply the restoration of an ancient landmark or essential of Freemasonry. In the Mysteries of Egypt and Greece, women and men worked together on an equal footing. Only in comparatively recent centuries were women excluded from the mysteries and privileges of the ancient rites that have been reincarnated in modern times as Freemasonry.</p>

  <p>When the first Grand Lodge of modern Freemasonry was organized in London in 1717 and subsequently adopted its constitution in 1723, it decided that women should not be admitted to membership, in keeping with the social customs and mores of that time. However, the position of women in the social, economic, educational, and governmental life of all nations has radically changed during the past several centuries. In almost every country, women have made substantial progress toward equal rights. The doors of institutions and professions previously closed to women have been opened wide, and nearly everywhere women are recognized as full citizens. It was only a matter of time before women would be admitted into full participation in Freemasonry, as in modern Co-Masonry. In time, the last vestiges of unjust discrimination will doubtless disappear and all Freemasonic activity, even that in now exclusively masculine Orders, will come to be shared equally by women. Of this prospect, Bro. J. S. M. Ward, a member of an exclusively masculine Order, says:</p>

  <p>"If in Freemasonry we possess valuable secrets and profound spiritual teaching, are we justified in excluding from our temples large sections of the human race? . . . The question today, then, is not can women be trusted with Masonic secrets for they have them. The question is whether it is just and wise to acknowledge their claims, as is being done in every walk of life, or whether we should continue to brand them as clandestine . . . whether we are acting justly in refusing our mothers, sisters, and wives . . . the spiritual and social help we ourselves derive from Freemasonry."</p>

  <p>The answer given by the Eastern Order of International Co-Freemasonry to Bro. Ward?s question is clear and unambiguous. Justice, fairness, and the progress of Freemasonry require that women must have the same rights and privileges as men. Furthermore, Freemasonic work at its optimum strength and power requires that men and women should work together in complete equality within Freemasonry as they now do elsewhere in civilized societies.</p>
