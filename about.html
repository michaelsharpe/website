      <h2>About Freemasonry <small>What is it all about?</small></h2>

      <p>Freemasonry as we know it today, has been in existence since
      the early eighteenth century, when four Masonic lodges in London united
      to form a Grand Lodge to charter new groups and coordinate their
      activities.</p>

      <p>The system practiced by those lodges is called Speculative
      Masonry as opposed to Operative Masonry, the craft of stonemasons.
      Freemasonry combines concepts from the building trade with a myth based
      on King Solomon's building of the holy temple in Jerusalem. It is thus
      a "system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."
      Freemasonry is not a religion but includes persons of all religious
      traditions, as well as those who have no religious affiliation.</p>

      <p>Freemasonry looks farther back, however, through the
      Rosicrucians of the Renaissance, the guilds of cathedral builders in
      the Middle Ages, along with the Trou­badours, Albigensians, and
      Templars, to the ancient Mysteries of Orpheus, Isis, and Eleusis. It
      has symbolic links with other similar initiatory orders throughout
      human history, being the chief modern form of the ancient Mysteries.</p>

      <p>In its outer form, Freemasonry is an organization of persons
      for study, for charitable and social cooperation and betterment, and
      for mutual support. In its inner form, however, it seeks, through the
      working of ancient rituals, to develop and integrate the individual
      Freemason in a balanced way, to bring about an inner realization of the
      link we each have with the Life force of the universe, to form a
      working unit for the evolution of humanity as a whole, and generally to
      serve the wellbeing of the planet and our fellows.</p>

      <p>Freemasonry has no doctrine. It is a system of symbols with
      implications for a way of living that leads to self-improvement through
      service to the world. As such, it is compatible with a variety of
      worldviews and religious or philosophical traditions, without being
      itself limited to any one of them.
      </p>

      <h3>The Nature of Freemasonry</h3>

      
      <p>Freemasonry is a design for living which, when followed, leads
      its initiates to a knowledge of their own inner divine nature and of
      their harmonious linkage with all life on the planet. It gives
      Freemasons a training that can eventually bring them to a gateway
      opening upon the Path that all human beings can walk to self-knowledge
      and to mutual support and cooperation.</p>

      <p>To achieve spiritual unfoldment on any path, the aspirant must
      earnestly seek after truth. All of us have the ability of realizing our
      inner potential, but like a seed planted in the soil, our potential has
      to be cared for and fostered before it can grow and bloom. Freemasonry
      provides a regimen of self-cultivation in the company of other
      aspirants to the Path.</p>

      <p>Freemasonry has its spiritual roots in the ancient Mysteries
      and is today the modern form of those mysteries. It is said to have
      been established on this planet by Great Ones, representatives of the
      universal and eternal Grand Lodge, who came to guide their younger
      brothers and sisters. Throughout the ages, Freemasonry has preserved
      the Ancient Wisdom of Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth, which might
      otherwise have been lost to humanity during periods of darkness. The
      symbols by which that Ancient Wisdom is expressed have varied with time
      and place, as civilizations have come and gone, but the fundamental
      design of the work and its great truths have remained unchanged. Modern
      Freemasonry is a treasury of spiritual values drawn from the Great
      Lodge above and following the Plan of the Great Architect.</p>

      <p>Some Freemasons are unaware of the depth of their heritage and
      of the spiritual power inherent in their ceremonies. They are satisfied
      with the ideal of brotherhood and the ethics and charitable work of
      Freemasonry. However, Bro. W. L. Wilmshurst, a noted authority in the
      masculine Order, has this to say about the nature of Freemasonry and
      its inner meaning:</p>

      <p>“It proclaims the fact that there exists a higher and more
      secret path of life than that which we normally tread. When the outer
      world and its pursuits and rewards lose their attractiveness for us, as
      sooner or later they will, we are compelled to turn back upon
      ourselves, to seek and knock at the door of a world within. It is upon
      this inner world, and the path to and through it, that Freemasonry
      promises light, charts the way, and indicates the qualifications and
      conditions of progress.”</p>

      <p>Co&#8209;Freemasonry adds two salient strengths to those shared by
      all Freemasonry. First, it is international, linking together people of
      various cultures in the shared task of building the spiritual temple of
      human unity. Second, it restores full Masonic privileges to women, and
      has thus taken an important step to restoring the spiritual splendor of
      the ancient Mysteries, in which the participation of both men and women
      was an essential factor. The term “Co-Freemasonry” or “Co-Masonry” was
      adopted to distinguish the Order from exclusively masculine or feminine
      groups and to indicate that both men and women are admitted to
      membership on equal footing. These strengths of universality and
      equality are essential elements for all Masonic work.</p>

      <p>In the Eastern Order of International Co&#8209;Freemasonry, the
      three Craft Degrees are worked, as well as Degrees of the Ancient and
      Accepted Scottish Rite and several Degrees of the York Rite. The Order
      is headquartered in India, but the term “Eastern” in its name refers to
      the symbolic East, the rising place of Light, rather than to a
      geographical direction. That spiritual orientation is expressed in a
      motto of the Eastern Order: Ex Oriente Lux (Light from the East).
      </p>

      <h3>What is Co-Freemasonry?</h3>

      <p>Co-Freemasonry started in France in the late nineteenth
      century to correct a flaw in the interpretation of the traditional
      'landmarks' (the fundamental principles, of Freemasonry). That flaw was
      the exclusion of women from the order. Although women have long been
      admitted to Masonic practices in various ways, Co-Freemasonry is
      dedicated to complete equality between the sexes, as well as among all
      races and religions.</p>

      <p>In the early 1880s a French lodge of masculine Freemasons
      determined to carry out Masonic principles of equality with
      consistency, and therefore initiated a woman. As a result of that act
      of conscience, a few years later a new lodge was formed in Paris, from
      which eventually developed several Orders of Freemasonry that admit men
      and women equally as well as several all-women Orders.</p>

      <p>The Eastern Order of International Co-Freemasonry is a
      twenty-first-century reform that practices traditional Masonry, but
      with a conscious realization of its inner, esoteric, psychological and
      spiritual significance as a contemporary expression of the Mysteries.
      It admits into its fellowship all properly prepared persons on equal
      footing, without distinction of race, religion, or sex.
      </p>

      <h3>A Brief History of Co-Freemasonry</h3>

      <p>During the latter half of the nineteenth century, several
      French Freemasons urged the admission of women into Masonry. They
      claimed that the rules adopted in earlier centuries were obsolete and
      that rules governing the physical qualifications of candidates, based
      only upon the customs of a particular time and place, could and should
      be changed. They emphasized the educational advantages and the splendid
      preparation for citizenship to be derived from Masonic teaching.</p>

      <p>In 1882 the concern for equality of the sexes resulted in the
      application of Marie Deraismes—a writer and lecturer on behalf of
      women’s rights—for membership in the Lodge Les Libres Penseurs (The
      Free Thinkers) at Le Pecq, near Paris. That lodge, working under the
      recently formed Symbolic Grand Lodge of France, asked for authorization
      to enter Mme. Deraismes. Being refused, the lodge withdrew from the
      French Grand Lodge and proceeded to carry out the initiation. Marie
      Deraismes was made a Mason in the presence of a large number of
      visitors. But French Freemasonry was not yet ready for such a forward
      step. Les Libres Penseurs lost its standing and became dormant.</p>

      <p>In 1893, however, Dr. Georges Martin, a French Senator and
      strong feminist supporter, began again. He had been present at the
      initiation of Marie Deraismes, and he knew Bro. Houbron, who had been
      Wor. Master of Les Libres Penseurs at the time of Mme. Deraismes’s
      initiation. He persuaded these two, together with several other French
      Freemasons, to start a new organization open to men and women equally.
      The result was the formation of a new Grand Lodge devoted to the
      equality of the sexes, and that same year Worshipful Lodge Human
      Rights, Co&#8209;Masonry (La Respectable Loge Le Droit Humain, Maçonnerie
      Mixte) was opened in Paris. Sixteen other prominent French women were
      entered, passed, and raised.</p>

      <p>Annie Besant, an English woman who was a prominent champion of
      women’s rights, especially for the poor and underprivileged, a leading
      figure in the Theosophical Society, and the first woman and only
      non-Indian to become President of the Indian National Congress, was
      initiated into the Co-Masonic Order in Paris. She returned to London
      and founded there the first Co-Masonic Lodge in the English-speaking
      world, consecrated on September 26, 1902. Soon, many other Lodges were
      started in Britain and, as Annie Besant traveled around the globe, her
      enthusiasm for and understanding of the inner side of Freemasonry
      spread to India, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the Americas,
      and other parts of the world, making Co-Masonry into an international
      body.</p>

      <p>Annie Besant also restored to Co-Masonic practice certain
      traditional elements that had been omitted from the French workings,
      such as belief in a Supreme Divine Intelligence (God, by whatever name
      and under whatever image conceived), the presence of a Volume of Sacred
      Lore on which Obligations are taken, and the shared great principles of
      Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. A version of the traditional Masonic
      ritual developed in India and known as the “Dharma Ritual” was adopted
      and became the basis for the rituals used around the world by Lodges
      that descend from her work.</p>

      <p>The Eastern Order of International Co-Freemasonry is directly
      descended from the Masonic Lodges founded as a result of Annie Besant’s
      pioneering work for Co-Masonry. It has fraternal relations with other
      independent Orders also derived from Annie Besant’s work, such as the
      Grand Lodge of Freemasonry for Men and Women in Great Britain. The term
      “Eastern” in its name, as noted elsewhere, refers not to geography but
      to the symbolic East, the dawning place of Light. It became an
      independent Co-Masonic Order dedicated to preserving the traditional
      ideals of Masonry restored by Annie Besant and to carrying on the work
      of Masonry as a spiritual discipline or form of Yoga: the Way of the
      Craftsman.</p>

      <h3>Reasons for Becoming a Freemason</h3>

      <p>Individuals become Freemasons for many different reasons. Each
      Mason, no doubt, has a different reason or set of reasons for entering
      the Order. But, whatever their initial motivations, all Freemasons
      share certain ideals and aspirations of fraternity, charity, and truth.
      In addition, all Co-Freemasons share a conviction about the equality of
      the sexes. And members of the Eastern Order of International
      Co-Freemasons place a particular emphasis on the inner, spiritual life
      of Freemasonry and on its application to living.</p>

      <p>What, then, are the most telling reasons for entering modern speculative Masonry?
      Essentially, they are two. As Bro. F. de P. Castells expresses one of
      them:</p>

      <blockquote>"And what is the aim of our Fraternity but to promote the
      world's progress and to guide men . . . to the Throne of God, the highest
      source of light, so aptly symbolized by the Fire in the Burning Bush
      that was ever ablaze but never consumed?"</blockquote>

      <p>The first reason for entering Masonry, and Co-Freemasonry more
      specifically, is to promote the world's progress. It is a means for
      service to humanity. The energies generated by a meeting of a
      Co-Masonic lodge, when released at the end of the meeting, add a pure
      and powerful spiritual force to the inner planes for the benefit of any
      who are in need of it.</p>

      <p>A second important reason for entering Freemasonry is that it
      offers a method for the mastery of one's emotional, mental, and spiritual
      nature. It puts the Freemason in touch with himself or herself. It is a
      form of Yoga, to use that popular Sanskrit term. In the words of the
      Very Ills. Bro. Louis Goaziou 33°:</p>

      <blockquote>"The development of moral character is an individual
      undertaking, the most important in this existence. Each individual must take the same
      path, overcome the same obstacles, and learn the same lessons that each
      and every other man has been obliged to do in his quest for Light and
      Truth."</blockquote>

      <p>The Co-Masonic system of self-discovery deals with the
      application of order, knowledge, strength, and symmetry to those aspects of one's
      nature that are in a state of disharmony or confusion. It is a
      systematic, scientific approach to wholeness, indicated by the Masonic
      axiom "Ordo ab Chao" - order out of chaos. Thus Freemasonry is service:
      spiritual service to humanity and spiritual service to oneself so that
      one may better serve others.
